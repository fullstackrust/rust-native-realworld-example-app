Conduit Client app, using the Iced desktop native UI framework: <https://github.com/hecrj/iced>

If you're looking for a Rust alternative to Electron or Neon, and don't want to worry about compatibility issues with using system webview, you've come to the right place.

Based on the Conduit Demo reference: <https://demo.realworld.io/>

And the Realworld Spec: <https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/spec>
